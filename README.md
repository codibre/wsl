Repo with useful wsl resources

## base wsl image

Here you can find a bae wsl image with:
* github cli
* nvm and node 22
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh with autosuggestions and syntax-highlighting
* docker
* /home/user using btrfs with zstd compression, for better disk usage


Also, every image of docker is put inside /home/user, to use the said compression, saving disk space
